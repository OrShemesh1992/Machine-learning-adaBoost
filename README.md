## About the project:

In this project we had to produce and use the adaboost algorithm of the machine learning course.
We took a dataset of boys and girls body heat data. We turned it into points when males are +1 and females are -1.
From the collection of points we created different rectangles and circles and calculated the errors by the algorithm.
In this project, gender should be different from the inside as opposed to the outside of the shape.
